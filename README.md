1. Monte.java 

**Birthday Paradox Monte Carlo Simulation**: This simulation aims to approximate the probability \( p_N \) that at least two people in a group of \( N \) individuals share the same birthday. Assuming a year has 365 days, for each \( N = 1, 2, 3, ..., 50 \), we generate random birthday assignments for \( N \) individuals and repeat this process \( M \) times (where \( M = 1000 \) for computational efficiency). We count the proportion of trials in which at least two individuals share the same birthday and use this to estimate \( p_N \). The results are presented in a table form.

2. MajorityItemProblem_1_1.java

Majority Item Problem Algorithm (Original):
The original algorithm checks if the current item is already in the set of "boxes" or an empty box is available to store it. The frequency of each item is updated accordingly.
