1. Monte.java 
  Birthday paradox :
  Monte-Carlo simulations to approximate pN . Consider a given integer N and M . Step 1: Generate a
  random vector P of size N such that each element of P is sampled from {1, 2, . . . , 365} uniformly at random
  independently, and check if there exists at least two values are the same in P (we call the trial “good” if
  there does); Step 2: Repeat Step 1 independently for M times and the output the value M ′/M as the
  approximation of pN , where M ′ is the number of times we end up with a good trial.
  
  For each given N = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 50, please run the above Monte-Carlo simulations to output the approximate
  value of pN with M reasonably large as long as you computer can afford to (e.g., you can set M = 1000).
