1. Monte.java 

**Birthday Paradox Monte Carlo Simulation**: This simulation aims to approximate the probability \( p_N \) that at least two people in a group of \( N \) individuals share the same birthday. Assuming a year has 365 days, for each \( N = 1, 2, 3, ..., 50 \), we generate random birthday assignments for \( N \) individuals and repeat this process \( M \) times (where \( M = 1000 \) for computational efficiency). We count the proportion of trials in which at least two individuals share the same birthday and use this to estimate \( p_N \). 

2. MajorityItemProblem_1_1.java

Majority Item Problem Algorithm (Original):
The original algorithm checks if the current item is already in the set of "boxes" or an empty box is available to store it. The frequency of each item is updated accordingly.

3.ReservoirSampling_2_1.java

Reservoir Sampling (2.1): This solution generates a random sample of size 70 from a data stream without replacement. The code follows the original definition of reservoir sampling to ensure each element in the stream has an equal chance of being included in the sample.

4.ReservoirSampling_2_2.java

This implementation of the reservoir sampling algorithm outputs a random sample of size 70 from a data stream without replacement. The algorithm ensures that every element in the stream has an equal probability of being selected.
