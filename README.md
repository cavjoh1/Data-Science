**Birthday Paradox Monte Carlo Simulation**: This simulation aims to approximate the probability \( p_N \) that at least two people in a group of \( N \) individuals share the same birthday. Assuming a year has 365 days, for each \( N = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 50 \), we generate random birthday assignments for \( N \) individuals and repeat this process \( M \) times (where \( M = 1000 \) for computational efficiency). We count the proportion of trials in which at least two individuals share the same birthday and use this to estimate \( p_N \). The results are presented in a table form.
